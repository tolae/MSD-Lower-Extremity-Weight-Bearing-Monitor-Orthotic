# MSD Eletronic Files
All the schematics and designs were done using Cadence Orcad 17.2. The files
in this directory was put under source control for ease of multi-tasking and
reducing the number of redudant work to make the same custom footprints.

## Important Directiories
 - <b>custom_parts</b>: Contains the custom components and pcb footprints
 required for layout.
 - <b>extenstion_1</b>: Contains the schematic and layout focusing on the first
 extenstion for the footpad.
 - <b>imported_parts</b>: Contains footprints and pads for external components
 such as the TMUX1109.
 - <b>main</b>: Contains the schematic and layout focusing on the primary
 footpad that will interface directly with the Arduino Nano.
 - <b>wiring_complete</b>: Contains the schematics for a complete wiring
 diagram of both the Arduino Nano and the Arduino Mega. This cannot be used for
 layout as there are no footprints associated with the parts.
