# MSD Lower Extremity Weight Bearing Monitor Orthotic

## Overview
Individuals with injury to the lower extremities often go through a type of physical therapy called gait training in which the ability to stand and walk may be improved. Depending on pain control and prescribed weight bearing status (non, toe touch, touchdown, partial, and full/weight bearing as tolerated), patients will gradually place more weight on the injured leg. However, at this time physical therapists have little ability to measure exactly how much weight a patient is bearing.
 
Many orthopedic patients who are recently going through the gait training process struggle with controlling how much weight to bear on a leg recovering from injury. Without proper monitoring, patients often exceed their prescribed weight bearing status which could result in delayed healing, further injury, added frustration, and added financial burden. Determining whether a patient is truly compliant to their weight bearing orders can be difficult for doctors, physical therapists, and patients without accurate readings and progress of the injury. The device proposed here would allow for improved accuracy and weight bearing compliance of the patientâ€™s lower extremities. This could also improve patient motivation and frustration, as progress should be tracked and maintained much more easily.
 
There has been no prior work done with this project.
 
This project would aim to develop and build a working orthotic prototype which could improve the weight bearing compliance and accuracy for leg orthotics while notifying the patient with alerts on whether they are putting too much weight on their foot during therapy.  Notification will also be relayed to the Physical Therapist such that they can direct the patient regarding weight bearing during the physical therapy process.  
 
Strong Memorial Hospital would like their physical therapy staff to be able to use this product with their orthopedic patients during physical therapy sessions within the acute care setting. This will allow physical therapists to more accurately educate patients regarding their weight bearing status, improving patient compliance and decreasing risk of complications after injury.
